# Event-Driven Architecture Workshop

## Welcome to the workshop ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Event-Driven Architecture workshop! In this workshop we will build an event-driven application for sending Christmas wishlist letters to Santa Claus.

### Letters to Santa ðŸŽ…

Send your Christmas list to Santa! You can ask for any LEGO set or a surprise from Santa's workshop! Santa is also keen to keep costs low this year, so doesn't want to use any Lambda functions.

Santa's elves open the wishlists sent to Santa and check everything looks legit! Santa has a central event bus for receiving gift requests. The elves can forward gifts on a wishlist to the event bus. Santa will then pick up the gift requests on Christmas Eve.
